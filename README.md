Leopard Data Content Storm Node.JS MySQL CMS

This code base is an free and open source version of Leopard Data's content management system
Content Storm.

Our goal with this code base was to provide a cms basis that ran against MariaDB/MySQL and 
node.js.  We leveraged the latest and greatest ace code editor to edit html raw and the tinymce
open source Wordpress wysiwig editor to make page editing within the cms.  

Feel free to leverage this code base as a basis for any project for any purpose.  If you require
any assistance and require support for this code base, please contact allan@leoparddata.com.
